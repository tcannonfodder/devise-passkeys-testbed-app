# Devise Passkeys Testbed App

https://github.com/tcannonfodder/devise

_Currently work is being done in the `sketch` branch, to keep the `main` branch clean so that we can use it as an example once the implementation is more defined_

## Setup

```
puma-dev link -n devise-passkeys
```

## Running the server

```
bin/start-puma
```

The app is now running at [https://devise-passkeys.test](https://devise-passkeys.test)
